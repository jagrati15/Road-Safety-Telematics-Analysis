# Road Safety Telematics Analysis ðŸš—

## Overview
This capstone project, developed at CU Boulder, explores how telematics data (GPS, speed, acceleration, etc.) can be used to profile driver behavior and enhance road safety. We applied clustering and classification techniques to identify risky drivers and suggest targeted policy actions.

## Objectives
- Perform EDA on raw telematics data from drivers
- Identify risky driving behavior using unsupervised learning (KMeans, DBSCAN)
- Classify driver profiles based on safety metrics
- Provide actionable insights for insurance providers and road safety experts

## Dataset
The dataset consisted of time-series vehicle telematics data including GPS coordinates, speed, acceleration, and more, recorded over multiple driving sessions.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn
- Machine Learning: scikit-learn (KMeans, Logistic Regression, DBSCAN)
- Clustering and classification algorithms
- Jupyter Notebooks, Google Colab
- GitHub

## Results
- Identified high-risk drivers using KMeans clustering on key behavioral metrics
- Developed classification models to categorize drivers into safe vs risky
- Achieved ~XX% classification accuracy (update with actual)
- Recommended safety improvements and scoring systems for commercial drivers
